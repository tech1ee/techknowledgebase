# 800-resources/

> Quick-reference materials, cheat sheets, and curated external links.

---

## Purpose

This section stores **reference-type content** that doesn't fit the deep-dive learning model of the content zones. Think of it as your personal reference shelf:

- **Cheat sheets** — condensed command references (CLI, SQL, regex, git)
- **Curated bookmarks** — categorized links to high-quality external resources
- **Tool configs** — reusable snippets, dotfiles, IDE settings
- **Quick-reference cards** — API surfaces, keyboard shortcuts, comparison tables

## How it differs from content zones

| | Content zones (100-500) | 800-resources/ |
|---|-----------|----------------|
| **Goal** | Understand concepts deeply | Look up facts quickly |
| **Format** | Explanatory text + code + diagrams | Tables, lists, commands |
| **Reading time** | 10-30 min | 30 sec - 2 min |
| **Example** | `jvm-gc-tuning.md` (deep-dive) | `jvm-flags-cheatsheet.md` (reference) |

## Planned structure

```
800-resources/
  cli/              — shell, git, docker, kubectl commands
  cheatsheets/      — language & framework quick refs
  bookmarks/        — curated external links by domain
  configs/          — reusable configs and snippets
```

## When to add here

Add a note here when:
- You keep looking up the same command/flag/syntax
- The content is a **lookup table**, not an explanation
- It fits on 1-2 screens without scrolling

If the material requires explanation of *why* — it belongs in a content zone (100-500).
