## Проверь себя

> [!question]- Почему в индексе 7 source-репозиториев, а не один "awesome-engineering-management"? Какую проблему решает агрегация из нескольких источников?
> Каждый awesome-list имеет свой bias: awesome-cto фокусируется на стартапах (25k+ звёзд), staffeng42 — на Staff+ IC треке (47 звёзд), kdeldycke — на переходе IC→EM. Один список не покрывает весь спектр от Individual Contributor до CTO. Агрегация устраняет слепые пятна: ты получаешь ресурсы и для найма, и для культуры, и для стратегии, и для карьерного роста.

> [!question]- В секции "Books" книги разделены на 4 категории. Почему "Culture & Diversity" выделена отдельно, а не включена в "People & Communication"?
> Culture & Diversity — это не просто коммуникация, а системная проблема организаций. Книги типа "Brotopia" и "Reset" описывают структурные барьеры в индустрии, а не техники общения. Выделение в отдельную категорию сигнализирует, что diversity — это стратегический вопрос для лидера (как [[team-culture]] и [[building-engineering-team]]), а не подкатегория soft skills.

> [!question]- Сравни секции "Hiring & Recruiting" и "Engineers & IC Track". Как они дополняют друг друга с точки зрения лидера?
> Hiring & Recruiting — это взгляд снаружи: как находить, оценивать и привлекать таланты. Engineers & IC Track — взгляд изнутри: как развиваются инженеры после найма (senior → staff → principal). Лидеру нужны оба: без понимания IC-трека ты не сможешь оценить кандидата на Senior+ позицию, а без навыков найма не сможешь реализовать карьерные ladder'ы в своей команде.

> [!question]- Почему в секции "Technical Debt" есть статья "Goodbye, Clean Code" (Dan Abramov)? Как это связано с leadership, а не просто с программированием?
> Статья Abramov показывает, что слепое следование "clean code" может быть формой tech debt (over-engineering). Для лидера это ключевой insight: решения о tech debt — это не binary (чисто/грязно), а trade-off между скоростью доставки и maintainability. Лидер должен уметь принимать решение "сейчас это достаточно хорошо", что связано с [[tech-debt-management]] и [[architecture-decisions]].

> [!question]- В индексе есть секция "Remote Work & Distributed Teams" с всего 6 ресурсами, тогда как "Hiring" содержит 20+. Почему такая диспропорция? Это проблема?
> Это отражает bias awesome-lists, собранных до 2020. Remote work стал массовым после пандемии, но многие списки были созданы раньше. Это не проблема индекса, а сигнал для лидера: для remote-тематики нужно дополнительно обращаться к GitLab All-Remote Guide и актуальным источникам. Связь с [[remote-team-communication]] в разделе communication заполняет этот пробел.

## Ключевые карточки

Сколько source-репозиториев агрегировано в индексе и какой самый крупный?
?
7 репозиториев. Самый крупный — kuchin/awesome-cto (25k+ звёзд, фокус на CTO и стартапах). Второй — ryanburgess/engineer-manager (10k+, подкасты/статьи/книги).

Какие 4 категории книг выделены в секции "Essential Reading"?
?
1) Management & Leadership (Andy Grove, Camille Fournier). 2) People & Communication (Difficult Conversations, Radical Candor). 3) Technical Leadership (Staff Engineer, Mythical Man-Month). 4) Strategy & Business (Hard Thing About Hard Things, Measure What Matters).

Что такое Rands Test и где он упоминается?
?
The Rands Test — чеклист здоровья инженерной организации от Michael Lopp (автора Managing Humans). Аналог Joel Test, но для менеджмента. Упоминается в секции Management Fundamentals.

Какие 3 Slack-сообщества рекомендованы для engineering leadership?
?
Rands Leadership Slack (engineering leadership), LeadDev Community (tech leadership), CTO Craft (CTOs). Это основные профессиональные сообщества для нетворкинга и обмена опытом.

Какие prioritization frameworks перечислены в индексе?
?
RICE Scoring, Eisenhower Matrix, MoSCoW, Kano Model, Weighted Scoring — 5 фреймворков для приоритизации задач и проектов.

Какие company handbooks указаны как эталонные?
?
GitLab Handbook, Basecamp Handbook, Valve Employee Handbook, HashiCorp Works, Atlassian Team Playbook. GitLab — самый подробный (публичный, 2000+ страниц).

Что такое Conway's Law и в какой секции он упоминается?
?
Conway's Law — организации проектируют системы, которые копируют их коммуникационную структуру. Упоминается в секции Organizational Design → Scaling Organizations. Критично для понимания связи между [[team-structures]] и архитектурой.

Какие ресурсы рекомендованы для первых 90 дней в роли CTO/VPE?
?
Две статьи: "First 90 Days as CTO/VPE" (Will Larson, lethain.com) и "First 30 Days in New Role" (Lara Hogan). Связано с материалом [[first-90-days]].

Что такое Project Aristotle и почему он важен для лидера?
?
Google Project Aristotle — исследование Google о том, что делает команду эффективной. Главный вывод: психологическая безопасность важнее состава команды. Опубликовано на rework.withgoogle.com.
