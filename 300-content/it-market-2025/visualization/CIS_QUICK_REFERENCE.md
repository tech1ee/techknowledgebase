## OUTSOURCING COMPANIES (2025 STATUS)

| Company | Russia | Belarus | Alt. Path | Status |
|---------|--------|---------|-----------|--------|
| EPAM | Closed | Minimal | Armenia/Georgia | Don't expect Russia hiring |
| DataArt | Closed | Closed | Georgia office | Redirect hiring confirmed |
| SoftServe | Cautious | Cautious | Relocate first | Possible if outside CIS |
| Toptal | Available | Available | Direct freelance | 20% acceptance rate |
| Lemon.io | Available | Available | Direct freelance | 40-50% acceptance |
| Turing | Available | Available | Direct contract | 30-40% acceptance |

**Verdict**: Skip expecting ex-Soviet HQs to hire; use freelance platforms instead (faster, less gatekeeping)

---

## CRYPTO PAYMENTS (For Russia/Belarus Immediate Solution)

**Safest Setup**:
1. Open Kraken account (still accepting CIS; others may block)
2. Freelance platform → USD to USDC (stablecoin)
3. Kraken: USDC → Your crypto wallet
4. Local: Crypto → Cash (P2P exchange or ATM)

**Timeline**: Payment received → wallet in 2 days → cash in hand in 5-7 days

**Fees**: 2-3% total (platform 1% + exchange 1-2%)

**Coins to prefer** (in order):
1. USDC (stable, widely accepted)
2. USDT (stable, slightly more adoption)
3. Bitcoin (volatile, harder to cash)
4. Monero (privacy, harder to exchange)

---

## LINKEDIN MESSAGING TEMPLATE (Copy-Paste)

```
[Name],

I noticed [Company] is building [specific feature/product].
I've implemented similar [technology] for [your past project],
achieving [specific metric: performance, scale, users].

Given your focus on [engineering challenge], I thought you
might find my background relevant.

Would be interested in chatting about your tech direction.

GitHub: [link]
```

**Expected response rate**: 9.36% (personalized) vs. 5.44% (generic)

---

**Week 2**: LeetCode (solve 15 more) + 1 system design case study
**Week 3**: 5 mock interviews + record yourself explaining portfolio
**Week 4**: Final interview prep + company-specific research

**Free resources**: LeetCode free tier + System Design Primer (GitHub)

---

## OUTSOURCING COMPANY SALARY REALITY

**Don't expect commission-based models**. These are salary/hourly positions:

- **Toptal**: Marketplace (you keep 70-75%), $100-200/hr average
- **Lemon.io**: Marketplace (you keep 80-90%), $45-95/hr average
- **Turing**: Employment-style ($30-80k/year equivalent)

**These are NOT good anymore (post-2022 changes)**:
- EPAM (stopped Russia/Belarus operations)
- DataArt (pivoted to Armenia/Georgia only)
- Luxoft (restricted hiring)

---

## RED FLAGS (AVOID THESE)

1. **Job posting asking for Upwork/Fiverr work on Russian account**
   - This suggests non-payment or scam (avoid)

2. **Company offering "arbitrage" work at $10/hr**
   - Too low; you can earn 3-5x elsewhere

3. **Visa requirement to complete project**
   - Legitimate companies don't require visa for freelance work

4. **Payment only in cash or untraceable currency**
   - Red flag for tax/legal issues

5. **No company website or LinkedIn presence**
   - Probably not legitimate (research first)

---

## SUCCESS RATE BENCHMARKS

**If you apply today to 100 positions**:

| Your Profile | Interviews Expected | Offers by Month 2 | Success % |
|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|----------|
| Junior + good portfolio | 5-10 | 1-2 | 20-30% |
| Junior + weak portfolio | 2-4 | 0-1 | 5-10% |
| Mid-level + prepped | 10-15 | 2-4 | 40-50% |
| Mid-level + not prepped | 4-8 | 1-2 | 15-25% |
| Senior + targeted approach | 20-30 | 5-8 | 60-80% |

**Rule of thumb**: 2-4% of applications → actual interview offers

---

## COUNTRY-SPECIFIC SHORTCUTS

**If in Kazakhstan**:
- Advantage: Can use Wise immediately
- Action: Apply to Central Asia-specific jobs (easier fit)
- Timeline: 6-10 weeks faster than Russia/Belarus path

**If in Kyrgyzstan**:
- Advantage: Cheapest living costs (extend runway)
- Action: Stay 6-12 months, build track record
- Timeline: Same as Kazakhstan, but lower burn rate

**If in Uzbekistan**:
- Advantage: IT Park tax benefits (30-40% salary boost if resident)
- Action: Get IT Park residency + do remote work (best hybrid)
- Timeline: 2-4 weeks for IT Park residency

**If in Armenia/Georgia (already relocated)**:
- Advantage: Full banking access, no payment delays
- Action: Aggressive application strategy (200+ applications)
- Timeline: 2-4 months to first gig

---

## MONTHLY BUDGET ESTIMATE

**If You Earn $40/hr (Full-Time Remote)**:

| Location | Monthly Income | Monthly Cost | Runway |
|----------|----------------|-------------|--------|
| Bishkek, KG | $6,400 | $500-700 | 10+ months |
| Tashkent, UZ | $6,400 | $800-1,000 | 7-8 months |
| Almaty, KZ | $6,400 | $1,200-1,500 | 4-5 months |
| Tbilisi, GA | $6,400 | $900-1,100 | 6-7 months |
| Yerevan, AM | $6,400 | $700-900 | 7-9 months |

**Verdict**: Remote income buys 5-10x lifestyle in Central Asia vs. Western countries
