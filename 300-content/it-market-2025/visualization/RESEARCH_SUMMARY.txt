================================================================================
CRITICAL WARNINGS
================================================================================

AVOID THESE MISTAKES:
1. Don't apply to Upwork (Russia/Belarus) - it's blocked
2. Don't list Russia/Belarus location publicly - use VPN + relocation
3. Don't send generic applications - 20 personalized > 100 generic

5. Don't ignore LinkedIn networking - worth 3-5x job board effort

PAYMENT RED FLAGS:
- "Cash only" payments → scam
- Extremely low rates ($10/hr for skilled work) → scam
- No company website/LinkedIn → not legitimate
- Asking for visa before freelance contract → red flag
- Untraceable cryptocurrency → avoid

PLATFORM RED FLAGS:
- New Upwork/Fiverr account as Russia/Belarus → will be suspended
- Payoneer without pre-2024 account → won't work for Russia
- Wise from Russia/Belarus address → will be blocked
- AWS new account from Russia → license restrictions
