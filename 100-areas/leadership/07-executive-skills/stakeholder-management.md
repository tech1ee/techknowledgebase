# Управление stakeholders

> **TL;DR:** Stakeholder management — не политика ради политики. Это ability to get things done in organizations. Map stakeholders: who cares, what they want, how to influence. Managing up: make your boss successful. Cross-functional: shared goals > your agenda.

---

## Stakeholder Mapping

```
IDENTIFY YOUR STAKEHOLDERS:
• Your boss
• Your boss's boss
• Peers (other EMs, Directors)
• Product/Design/etc.
• Other departments (Sales, Finance)
• External (customers, vendors)

MAP BY POWER/INTEREST:
              HIGH POWER
           ┌─────────────────┐
           │ KEEP SATISFIED  │ MANAGE CLOSELY
           │ (infrequent,    │ (regular contact,
           │  high level)    │  key players)
           ├─────────────────┼─────────────────┐
LOW        │ MONITOR         │ KEEP INFORMED   │ HIGH
INTEREST   │ (minimal        │ (regular        │ INTEREST
           │  effort)        │  updates)       │
           └─────────────────┴─────────────────┘
              LOW POWER
```

## Understanding Stakeholders

```
FOR EACH KEY STAKEHOLDER, KNOW:

WHAT:
• What do they care about?
• What are their goals/OKRs?
• What problems keep them up at night?

HOW:
• How do they prefer communication?
• How do they make decisions?
• How much detail do they want?

WHY:
• Why might they support your initiative?
• Why might they resist?
• What's their past experience?

RELATIONSHIP:
• Current state (ally, neutral, opponent)
• Trust level
• History together
```

## Managing Up

```
PRINCIPLES:

1. MAKE YOUR BOSS SUCCESSFUL
   Their success = your success
   Anticipate their needs
   No surprises

2. UNDERSTAND THEIR STYLE
   Detail-oriented vs big picture?
   Written vs verbal?
   Frequent check-ins vs autonomy?

3. COMMUNICATE PROACTIVELY
   Bad news early
   Status before asked
   Recommendations with options

4. KNOW THEIR PRESSURES
   What are they worried about?
   Who pressures them?
   What makes them look good?

5. BUILD TRUST THROUGH RELIABILITY
   Do what you say
   Meet deadlines
   Admit mistakes early
```

## Influence Without Authority

```
TACTICS:

1. FIND SHARED GOALS
   "We both want X. Here's how Y helps."

2. UNDERSTAND THEIR PRIORITIES
   Frame your ask in their language.
   WIIFM (What's In It For Me)?

3. BUILD RELATIONSHIPS BEFORE NEED
   Coffee chats
   Help them when you can
   Social capital

4. USE DATA AND LOGIC
   Not "I think" but "Data shows"
   Business impact, not opinion

5. FIND CHAMPIONS
   Who supports this already?
   Can they advocate?

6. START SMALL
   Pilot, not revolution
   Build credibility
```

## Dealing with Difficult Stakeholders

```
RESISTOR:
• Understand their concerns genuinely
• Address objections directly
• Find common ground
• Involve them in solution

BLOCKER:
• Escalate if necessary (carefully)
• Find alternative path
• Document decisions
• Don't take personally

ABSENT:
• Schedule recurring time
• Create urgency
• Find proxy decision-maker
• Over-communicate in writing
```
