# Где искать кандидатов

> **TL;DR:** Referrals — лучший канал (5x better retention). Но не достаточно для масштаба. Диверсифицируй: referrals + inbound (employer brand) + outbound (active sourcing). Passive candidates (не ищут работу) часто лучше, но требуют больше effort. Персонализация outreach критична — generic messages = 5% response, персонализированные = 30%+.

---

## Зачем это нужно?

### Типичная ситуация

Открыта позиция. Ждём inbound applications. Приходит 100 резюме, 95 — не fit. Подходящие кандидаты не откликаются — у них уже есть работа. Pipeline пустой. Позиция открыта месяцами.

**Без активного sourcing:**
- Зависимость от случайных откликов
- Долгий time-to-hire
- Ограниченный talent pool
- Проигрыш конкурентам

**С системным sourcing:**
- Проактивный pipeline
- Access к passive candidates
- Faster hiring
- Качественнее hires

### Статистика

| Метрика | Значение | Источник |
|---------|----------|----------|
| Referral hires retention (1 year) | 45% better | LinkedIn |
| Time to hire: referral vs other | 29 vs 55 days | Jobvite |
| Passive candidates interested in new role | 70% | LinkedIn |
| Response rate: generic vs personal outreach | 5% vs 30% | Yello |

### Activating Referrals

```
HOW TO ASK FOR REFERRALS:

EMAIL TO TEAM:
"Team, мы ищем [Role].

Кто приходит на ум?
Даже если не уверены — лучше больше имён.

Бонус: $X при найме.

1-ON-1 ASK (более эффективно):
"Кто лучший [engineer] с кем ты работал
в [Previous Company]? Думаешь, они могли бы
быть открыты к разговору?"
