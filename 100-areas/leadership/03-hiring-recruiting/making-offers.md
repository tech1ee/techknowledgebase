# Офферы и переговоры

> **TL;DR:** Оффер — не конец процесса, а начало negotiation. 70% кандидатов negotiate. Будь готов. Sell throughout процесса, не только на offer stage. Персонализируй pitch: money matters, но mission, growth, team — часто решающие факторы. Exploding offers работают против вас — дают время подумать.

---

## Зачем это нужно?

### Типичная ситуация

Отличный кандидат прошёл интервью. Отправили оффер по email. Тишина. Через неделю — отказ, пошёл к конкуренту. Или: "У меня другой оффер на 20% больше". Паника. Или принял, но через месяц ушёл — "не то, что ожидал".

**Без системного closing:**
- Lose candidates на финишной прямой
- Reactive negotiation
- Bad first impression
- Early turnover

**С правильным подходом:**
- Higher acceptance rate
- Win-win negotiations
- Excited new hires
- Better retention

### Статистика

## Пошаговый процесс

### Pre-Offer Conversation

**When:** After positive debrief, before formal offer

```
SCRIPT:
"[Name], great news — the team was very
impressed and we'd like to move forward
with an offer.

Before I put together the details, I want
to make sure we're aligned:

1. What are you looking for in terms of
   compensation? Any specific numbers in mind?

2. Are you considering other opportunities?
   Where are you in those processes?

3. What's your ideal start date?

4. Is there anything about the role or
   company you're still uncertain about?"

PURPOSE:
• Avoid wasting time on misaligned offer
• Surface competing offers early
• Address concerns before offer
• Show you care about their needs
```

### Verbal Offer Call

**When:** Before sending written offer

```
STRUCTURE (15-20 min):

1. CONGRATULATIONS [2 min]
"[Name], I'm excited to share that we'd
like to offer you the [Role] position!

The team was really impressed with [specific
feedback]. We think you'd be a great addition."

2. WALK THROUGH OFFER [5 min]
"Let me walk you through the details:

• Base salary: $X
• Equity: X shares vesting over 4 years
• Sign-on bonus: $X
• Annual bonus target: X%

Total first-year comp is approximately $X.

Benefits include [highlights].
Start date we're thinking is [date]."

3. GAUGE REACTION [5 min]
"What's your initial reaction?"
[LISTEN]

"Does this align with what you were hoping for?"
[LISTEN]

"What questions do you have?"
[LISTEN]

4. NEXT STEPS [3 min]
"I'll send the written offer today.
Take some time to review — how does [date]
work as a deadline to get back to us?

Is there anyone else you'd like to speak
with before deciding? Happy to arrange."

5. CLOSE
"We're really excited about the possibility
of you joining. What else can I do to help
you make this decision?"
```

### Handling Counter-Offers

```
WHEN THEY ASK FOR MORE:

STEP 1: ACKNOWLEDGE
"I appreciate you sharing that. Let me
make sure I understand what's important to you."

STEP 2: CLARIFY
"Is the base salary the primary concern,
or are there other aspects of the offer?"

STEP 3: UNDERSTAND CONTEXT
"Can you help me understand what would make
this a clear yes for you?"

"Is there a competing offer? Can you share
details so I can see what we can do?"

STEP 4: RESPOND
Option A — Can accommodate:
"Let me see what I can do. I'll get back
to you by [time]."

Option B — Cannot accommodate fully:
"I understand. Here's what I CAN do:
[alternative — sign-on, equity, etc.]
Would that work?"

Option C — Cannot accommodate:
"I wish I could. Unfortunately, this is
the best we can offer for this level.
Here's what I can share about growth path
and future compensation..."
```

### When Competing Offers

```
APPROACH:

1. GET DETAILS
"Can you share the other offer details?
It helps me understand what we're competing with."

2. COMPARE APPLES-TO-APPLES
• Total comp, not just base
• Equity value (conservative)
• Benefits value
• Growth trajectory

3. SELL YOUR STRENGTHS
Focus on what differentiates you:
• Mission/impact
• Team quality
• Growth opportunity
• Culture/flexibility
• Stability/trajectory

4. DON'T GET INTO BIDDING WAR
"We don't want to get into a back-and-forth
bidding war. Here's our best and final:
[offer]. We hope you'll choose us for reasons
beyond just the number."
```

### Counter-Offer Response (When Can't Match)

```
"Thanks for being transparent about your
other offer. I appreciate that.

I want to be honest — we can't match that
base salary. Here's why:

Our compensation philosophy ties to levels,
and [base] is at the top of our band for
this level.

But here's what I CAN do:

  potential level adjustment

## Распространённые ошибки

### Ошибка 1: Offer by Email Only

**Как выглядит:**
Send offer letter. Wait. Hope they accept.

**Почему это проблема:**
- No chance to gauge reaction
- Can't address concerns
- Feels transactional
- Easy to decline via email

**Как исправить:**
```
ALWAYS:
1. Phone call first (verbal offer)
2. Written offer after call
3. Follow-up call if questions
```

### Ошибка 2: Exploding Offers

**Как выглядит:**
"We need an answer by Friday" (2 days notice).

**Почему это проблема:**
- Feels coercive
- Damages employer brand
- Best candidates have options — they decline
- Accepted under pressure → early regret

**Как исправить:**
```
REASONABLE DEADLINE:
• 5-7 business days standard
• Extend if they're completing other interviews
• "We'd love to know by [date]. Let me know
  if you need more time."
```

### Ошибка 3: Only Selling Money

**Как выглядит:**
Focus entirely on compensation. Ignore mission, team, growth.

**Почему это проблема:**
- Competing on price alone = lose to higher bidder
- Miss non-monetary motivators
- Not sustainable differentiation

**Как исправить:**
```
SELL THE WHOLE PACKAGE:
• Mission and impact
• Team quality ("who you'll work with")
• Growth opportunity
• Culture and flexibility
• Interesting problems
• Company trajectory

Then: competitive compensation
```

### Ошибка 4: No Flexibility

**Как выглядит:**
"Take it or leave it. That's the offer."

**Почему это проблема:**
- Feels rigid
- Misses creative solutions
- Candidates feel undervalued

**Как исправить:**
```
ALWAYS HAVE LEVERS:
• Sign-on bonus
• Start date
• Remote flexibility
• Title within reason
• Extra equity
• Accelerated review
```

```
COMPENSATE WITH:
• Equity (cheaper for company)
• Growth story
• Flexibility (remote, hours)
• Mission/impact
• Title
• Early review promise
```

### For Competing Offer Situations

```
SPEED IS KEY:
• Same-day turnaround on decisions
• Compress approval process
• Don't make them wait
• Match deadline of other offer
```
