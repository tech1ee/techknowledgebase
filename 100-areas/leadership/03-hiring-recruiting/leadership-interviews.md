# Интервью на EM/Director/VP/CTO

> **TL;DR:** Leadership hiring — highest stakes, highest failure rate (40-50% при executive level). Technical skills вторичны — оценивай leadership competencies: people development, strategic thinking, execution, communication. Past behavior predicts future: глубокое погружение в track record. References критичны — 5-10 calls для senior roles.

## Зачем это нужно?

### Типичная ситуация

Нужен Engineering Manager. Наняли лучшего IC — "он знает продукт, команда его уважает". Через год: не справляется с people management, команда разваливается, сам выгорает. Или: наняли VP Engineering с great resume. Через 6 месяцев — culture clash, half the team leaves.

**Без специального процесса для leadership:**
- 40-50% executive hires fail
- Дорогая ошибка (сотни тысяч $)
- Team disruption
- Упущенное время

**С правильным процессом:**
- Better prediction
- Culture alignment
- Clear expectations
- Higher success rate

### Статистика

| Метрика | Значение | Источник |
|---------|----------|----------|
| Executive hiring failures | 40-50% | HBR |
| Cost of failed executive | $2.7M average | CEB |
| Time to identify misfit | 18 months average | DDI |
| Importance of references | 5-10 calls = 3x better outcomes | ghSmart |

## Behavioral Deep-Dive (Topgrading Style)

### Chronological Walkthrough

```
FOR EACH PREVIOUS ROLE (last 3-4):

"Walk me through your time at [Company].

1. What were you hired to do?
2. What accomplishments are you most proud of?
3. What were your low points or failures?
4. What would your boss say about your
   performance? Strengths? Weaknesses?
5. Why did you leave?"

TIME PER ROLE: 20-30 minutes
TOTAL: 60-90 minute interview

KEY TECHNIQUE:
After each answer: "Tell me more about that"
Probe specifics: who, what, when, results
```

### Threat of Reference Check (TORC)

```
TECHNIQUE:
"When we speak with [boss name] — and we will
as part of reference checks — what will they
say about your performance?"

WHY IT WORKS:
• Creates honesty incentive
• Surfaces real weaknesses
• Identifies potential red flags

FOLLOW-UP:
"You mentioned they'd say [weakness].
Tell me more about that. What happened?"
```

---

## Reference Calls

### Who to Call

```
FOR SENIOR ROLES (Director+):

REQUIRED (5-7 calls):
• Former bosses (2-3)
• Former peers (2)
• Former reports (2)

NICE TO HAVE:
• Board members
• Customers/vendors
• People who worked with them years ago

WHO TO CALL:
✓ People THEY don't suggest (backdoor)
✓ People who know them well (2+ years)
✓ People who saw them under pressure
✓ Recent references + older ones

BACKDOOR REFERENCES:
Find through LinkedIn connections.
"I see you worked at [Company] same time as [Candidate].
Could I ask about your experience working with them?"
```

### Reference Questions

```
OPENING:
"Thanks for taking the time. I'll keep this
to 15-20 minutes.

[Name] is a finalist for [Role] at [Company].
I understand you [relationship].
Mind sharing your perspective?"

PERFORMANCE:
"On a scale of 1-10, how would you rate
[Name]'s overall performance?"
(Most say 7-8. Below 7 is concerning.)

"What were their biggest strengths?"
"What were their areas for development?"

SPECIFICS:
"How did they handle [specific situation
mentioned in interview]?"

"How did they build and develop their team?"

"How did they handle underperformers?"

"How were they at managing up?"

FINAL:
"Would you work with them again?"
(Hesitation is a red flag)

"Is there anything I should know that
I haven't asked?"

"Is there anyone else I should talk to?"
```
