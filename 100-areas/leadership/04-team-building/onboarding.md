# Онбординг инженеров

> **TL;DR:** Первые 90 дней определяют успех найма. Structured onboarding: +62% productivity, -50% time to first contribution. Цель: время до первого meaningful contribution. Buddy + manager + documentation. Not "sink or swim" — это дорого и cruel.

"Everyone's too busy"
→ New hire feels isolated

❌ NO EARLY WINS:

→ Demoralization

❌ INFORMATION OVERLOAD:
60-page doc on day 1
→ Overwhelm, nothing retained

✓ INSTEAD:
Structured plan + buddy + small early wins
