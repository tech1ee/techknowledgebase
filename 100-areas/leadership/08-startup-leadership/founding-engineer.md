# Founding Engineer

> **TL;DR:** Founding engineer = first 1-5 non-founder engineers. High risk, high reward. Role: build everything, wear all hats, shape culture. Equity: 0.5-2% typical. Due diligence: founders, market, runway. Not for everyone — requires comfort with chaos.

---

## What is a Founding Engineer?

```
DEFINITION:
First 1-5 engineers hired by founders.
Not a cofounder, but close.
Significant equity, significant impact.

TYPICAL TITLES:
• Founding Engineer
• Engineer #1 / #2 / #3
• Early Engineer
• Principal Engineer (sometimes)

NOT THE SAME AS:
• Cofounder (no founder equity/control)
• Senior Engineer at startup (later stage)
• Contractor (no equity, no ownership)
```

## Role Expectations

```
WHAT YOU'LL DO:

WEEK 1-4:
• Understand the product vision
• Assess existing code (if any)
• Set up development environment
• Ship first feature

MONTH 1-3:
• Build core product features
• Make technology decisions
• Set up CI/CD, monitoring
• Establish coding practices

MONTH 3-6:
• Own entire technical areas
• Participate in hiring
• Customer calls and feedback
• Architecture evolution

ONGOING:
• Everything that needs doing
• Product, design, support overlap
• Process creation
• Culture shaping

TYPICAL DAY:
09:00 - Customer call (feedback)
10:00 - Coding sprint
13:00 - Product discussion with CEO
14:00 - More coding
16:00 - Deploy to production
17:00 - Fix something that broke
18:00 - Interview candidate
```

## Required Mindset

```
MUST HAVE:

✓ Comfort with ambiguity
  "We don't know the answer yet"

✓ Ownership mentality
  "If not me, then who?"

✓ Scrappiness
  "Good enough > perfect"

✓ Speed orientation
  "Ship today, iterate tomorrow"

✓ Resilience
  "Failed? Learn and move on"

✓ Generalist capability
  "I'll figure it out"

RED FLAGS (for you):
• Need clear specifications
• Prefer deep specialization
• Uncomfortable with pivots
• Require work-life balance
• Want stable career progression
```

## Evaluating the Opportunity

```
FOUNDERS ASSESSMENT:

QUESTIONS TO ASK:
• Why are you building this?
• What's your unfair advantage?
• How long have you worked together?
• What happens when you disagree?
• What's your fundraising status?

GREEN FLAGS:
✓ Prior startup experience
✓ Domain expertise
✓ Complementary skills
✓ Existing traction
✓ Strong network

RED FLAGS:
✗ First-time founders with no domain knowledge
✗ Can't articulate vision clearly
✗ Cofounder tension visible
✗ Unrealistic expectations
✗ Won't share financials

MARKET ASSESSMENT:

QUESTIONS:
• Why now?
• Who are competitors?
• What's the market size?
• Who are early customers?

RESOURCES:
• Crunchbase (funding history)
• LinkedIn (team background)
• G2/Capterra (if B2B)
• Twitter/X (founder presence)
```

## Equity & Compensation

```
TYPICAL RANGES (2024-2025):

FOUNDING ENGINEER (1-3):
Equity: 0.5% - 2.0%
Salary: 60-80% of market rate

EARLY ENGINEER (4-10):
Equity: 0.25% - 0.75%
Salary: 70-90% of market rate

VESTING:
Standard: 4 years, 1-year cliff
Meaning: 25% after year 1, then monthly

WHAT TO NEGOTIATE:
• Equity percentage
• Strike price timing
• Acceleration on acquisition
• Extended exercise window

QUESTIONS TO ASK:
• What's the current valuation?
• How many shares outstanding?
• What's the option pool?
• What's the preference stack?
• What's the runway?

CALCULATING VALUE:

Your shares: 50,000
Outstanding: 10,000,000
Your %: 0.5%

If exit at $100M:
Simplified: $100M × 0.5% = $500K
Reality: Less due to preferences, dilution
```

## Equity Deep Dive

```
UNDERSTANDING YOUR OFFER:

SHARES vs PERCENTAGE:
Always ask for percentage.
Shares alone meaningless.
"50,000 shares" = could be 5% or 0.05%

DILUTION:
Your % will decrease over time.
Each funding round dilutes.
Example:
Start: 1%
After Series A: 0.7%
After Series B: 0.5%
Normal and expected.

PREFERENCES:
Investors get paid first.
1x non-participating = investors get money back first
2x participating = investors get 2x, then share rest

409A VALUATION:
Fair market value for tax purposes.
Lower = better for you (lower strike price).
Ask when last 409A was done.

EXERCISE SCENARIOS:
Leave before IPO/exit:
90 days to exercise (usually)
Cost = shares × strike price
Some companies offer extended windows
```

## Due Diligence Checklist
