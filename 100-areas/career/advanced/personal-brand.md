# Personal Brand: как стать узнаваемым в своей нише

80% рекрутеров считают personal branding важным при оценке кандидатов. Но personal brand — не о становлении Twitter-инфлюенсером. Это о consistent visibility в своей нише. Чтобы когда открывается позиция, твоё имя всплывало первым.

---

## Что такое personal brand для developer

```
НЕ ЭТО:
• Миллион followers
• Постоянный контент каждый день
• "Thought leadership" без substance
• Self-promotion

А ЭТО:
• Узнаваемость в узкой нише
• Reputation for quality work
• Findable когда ищут expert
• Trusted voice on specific topics

ЦЕЛЬ:
"I know someone who's good at [X]" → твоё имя

ПРИМЕР НИШИ:
Не: "Android Developer"
А: "Compose migration expert" или "KMP architecture specialist"
```

---

## Multi-Platform Presence

### GitHub (must-have)

```
PROFILE:
• Custom profile README:
  - Who you are (2-3 sentences)
  - What you build
  - How to connect
  - Pinned: 4-6 best repos

REPOSITORIES:
• Quality > quantity
• 3-5 well-documented projects
• Clear READMEs with:
  - What it does
  - How to use
  - Screenshots/demos
  - Tech stack

ACTIVITY:
• Consistent commits (doesn't need to be daily)
• Contributions to popular projects
• Thoughtful issue comments

ADVANCED:
• GitHub Actions in your repos
• Badges (build status, coverage)
• Releases with changelogs

"Your GitHub is proof of work.
Your LinkedIn is proof of presence."
```

### LinkedIn (visibility layer)

```
PROFILE OPTIMIZATION:
→ См. [[linkedin-optimization]] для деталей

CONTENT STRATEGY (70/20/10):
• 70% Technical insights
  - Problem-solving approaches
  - Architecture decisions
  - Code patterns

• 20% Industry trends
  - Technology analysis
  - Predictions
  - Tool comparisons

• 10% Personal experiences
  - Career lessons
  - Learning journeys
  - Team wins

FREQUENCY:
• 1-2 posts per week достаточно
• Regular comments (daily 5 min)
• Share/react to others

CONSISTENCY > VOLUME
```

### Technical Blog

```
OPTIONS:
• Medium (discovery built-in)
• Dev.to (developer community)
• Hashnode (custom domain free)
• Personal site (full control)

CONTENT IDEAS:
• "How I solved [specific problem]"
• "[Technology A] vs [Technology B] for [use case]"
• "Lessons learned migrating to [X]"
• "Architecture decisions in [project]"

FREQUENCY:
• 1-2 articles per month достаточно
• Quality >> quantity
• Evergreen content better than news

SEO:
• Title with keywords
• Good meta description
• Internal links
• Share on LinkedIn/Twitter
```

### Twitter/X (optional but valuable)

```
FOR DEVELOPERS:
• Tech Twitter is alive and well
• Shorter format = easier to start
• Threads для deeper content
• Real-time industry discussions

GETTING STARTED:
• Follow key people in your niche
• Reply thoughtfully (not "great point!")
• Retweet with your take
• Start с small observations

THREAD FORMAT:
"Thread: 5 things I learned migrating to Compose"
1/5: [insight]
2/5: [insight]
...
```

---

## Content Strategy

### What to Create

```
LOW EFFORT, HIGH VALUE:
• Quick tips (code snippets)
• Tool recommendations
• Bug fixes you found
• "Today I learned" posts

MEDIUM EFFORT:
• How-to tutorials
• Comparison articles
• Conference talk summaries
• Book reviews

HIGH EFFORT, HIGHEST VALUE:
• In-depth technical guides
• Open source projects
• Video tutorials
• Conference talks
```

### Content Multiplication

```
ONE IDEA → MULTIPLE FORMATS:

Start: Solve a tricky problem at work

→ Tweet thread testing the idea
→ LinkedIn post with more context
→ Medium article with full details
→ GitHub repo with code examples
→ YouTube video walkthrough
→ Conference talk proposal

EACH FORMAT:
• Reaches different audience
• Reinforces your expertise
• Creates network effect
• Minimal extra work per format
```

### Authenticity Over Polish

```
РАБОТАЕТ:
• "I spent 3 hours debugging this, turns out..."
• "Here's a mistake I made and what I learned"
• "I tried [X] and it didn't work because..."
• Showing work-in-progress

НЕ РАБОТАЕТ:
• Only showing perfect outcomes
• Never admitting mistakes
• Over-produced content
• Fake enthusiasm

"People connect with the journey, not just the destination."
```

---

## Building in Public

```
CONCEPT:
Share your work as you create it, not just final results.

EXAMPLES:
• "Starting a new side project: [goal]"
• "Week 2 update: hit a blocker with [X]"
• "Figured it out! Here's how..."
• "Shipped! Here's what I learned"

BENEFITS:
• Content is natural (не выдумывать)
• Shows thought process
• Creates ongoing engagement
• Accountability to finish

FORMATS:
• Twitter threads
• LinkedIn posts
• Blog series
• YouTube devlogs
```

---

## Minimum Viable Personal Brand

```
IF YOU HAVE 30 MIN/WEEK:

GitHub (10 min):
• Update profile README
• Pin best repositories
• Write good READMEs

LinkedIn (15 min):
• Optimize profile once
• 1 post per week
• 5 comments/reactions daily

Twitter (5 min):
• Follow key people
• 2-3 tweets per week
• Engage with threads

THAT'S IT.
Consistency > Volume
4 weeks of this > 1 viral post
```

---

## What NOT To Do

```
❌ Try to be everywhere
   → Pick 2-3 platforms max

❌ Post every day just to post
   → Quality content when you have something to say

❌ Only self-promote
   → Share others' work, help, engage genuinely

❌ Copy others' style
   → Your voice is your differentiator

❌ Chase trends blindly
   → Stay in your niche of expertise

❌ Ignore engagement
   → Reply to comments, thank people

❌ Give up after a month
   → Brand building takes 6-12 months to see results
```

## Metrics That Matter

```
VANITY METRICS (не важно):
• Follower count
• Likes on posts
• Impressions

MEANINGFUL METRICS:
• Inbound messages from recruiters
• "I know your work" in interviews
• Referrals from your content
• Speaking invitations
• Job offers without applying

TRACKING:
• Monthly: LinkedIn profile views
• Quarterly: Inbound opportunities
• Yearly: Career progression
```

---

## Long-Term Strategy

```
YEAR 1: Foundation
• Optimize profiles (GitHub, LinkedIn)
• Start creating content (1x/week)
• Pick your niche
• Build initial connections

YEAR 2: Growth
• Increase output if comfortable
• Guest posts / collabs
• Speaking at meetups
• Growing specific reputation

YEAR 3+: Authority
• Known in your niche
• Inbound > outbound
• Speaking at conferences
• Mentoring others

COMPOUND EFFECT:
Content from year 1 still brings traffic in year 3.
Network built early becomes referral source later.
Patience is the key differentiator.
```
